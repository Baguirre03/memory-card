Second project with react!! This one, I had a lot of fun making. React i sreally starting to click in my brain and working with an API for this was a lot of fun!

### Objectives

- [x] Create new react project
- [x] Plan out components and how they will interact in `plan.md`
- [x] Begin making components and organizing the code
- [x] Begin combining components inside of `App.jsx`
- [x] Figure out how to keep track of state, as well as load the API's images and data once the app is loaded and correctly use that data to display on the DOM
- [x] `useState` and `useEffect` correctly
- [x] Fix URL Img bug
- [x] Finalize project and style with animations!

### What I learned and What I would do differently

#### Learned:

- Basics of react!! Super happy to learn this and excited to learn more
- `useEffect` to handle side affects
- more on `useState` and how to handle multiple states and pass them down into components
- Orginization of components

#### Differently:

- Overall super happy with this project, had a lot of fun with it and was able to make it attack on titan theme!
